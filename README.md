# 🍺 Here4Beer - AI-Powered Food Supply Chain Optimizer

AI-driven demand forecasting and supply chain optimization for food producers, starting with breweries and food factories.

## 🚀 Problem & Solution

### The Problem

Food producers face critical challenges in supply chain management:

- **Overproduction** → Spoilage, waste, and increased costs
- **Underproduction** → Shortages, missed sales opportunities
- **Manual planning** → Time-consuming, error-prone forecasting
- **Poor inventory visibility** → Inefficient raw material ordering
- **Risk blindness** → Lack of early warning systems for supply issues

### Our Solution

Here4Beer provides an intelligent AI assistant that transforms simple data uploads into actionable supply chain insights:

📊 **Smart Data Analysis** - Upload CSV files (sales history, inventory, recipes) for instant AI processing
📈 **Demand Forecasting** - Predict future demand for each product using advanced LLM reasoning
🏭 **Production Planning** - Generate optimized weekly production schedules
🛒 **Procurement Intelligence** - Automated raw material ordering recommendations
⚠️ **Risk Monitoring** - Early alerts for spoilage, shortages, and overstock scenarios
💬 **Natural Language Insights** - Human-friendly summaries for decision makers

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application consists of three core services:

- **Frontend (Clotho)** - React-based dashboard for data visualization and interaction
- **Backend API** - FastAPI service handling data processing and analysis
- **Agent Service** - Specialized AI agent for food industry insights

## ✨ Key Features

- **CSV Data Processing** - Upload and analyze sales history, inventory, and recipe data
- **AI-Powered Forecasting** - Leverage Amazon Bedrock LLMs for demand prediction
- **Provider Database** - Comprehensive food supplier search and management
- **Email Integration** - Parse order emails and generate professional responses
- **Real-time Analytics** - Interactive dashboards with charts and alerts
- **Multi-Service Architecture** - Scalable microservices design

## 🔮 Future Integrations

### Gmail MCP Integration

Integration of Gmail MCP (Model Context Protocol) with the agent service to enable:

- **Direct Email Access** - Connect directly to Gmail accounts for order processing
- **Automated Email Parsing** - Real-time parsing of incoming supplier and customer emails
- **Smart Email Responses** - AI-generated responses based on order context and provider database
- **Email-Driven Workflows** - Trigger forecasting and procurement based on email orders

**Implementation Path**: Integrate Gmail MCP with `agent-service/app/services/agent_class.py` to extend the existing email parsing tools with live Gmail connectivity.

### CSV Upload API Enhancement

Development of a dedicated API endpoint for direct CSV database integration:

- **Bulk Data Import** - Direct upload of supplier and inventory CSV files to the provider database
- **Data Validation** - Automated schema validation and error reporting
- **Real-time Updates** - Live database updates as new supplier data becomes available
- **Batch Processing** - Handle large CSV files with progress tracking

**Implementation Path**: Create new FastAPI endpoints in the backend service for CSV processing and database integration, extending the current provider database functionality.

### Additional Planned Features

- **Multi-tenant Support** - Separate environments for different food producers
- **Advanced Analytics** - Seasonal forecasting and trend analysis
- **Mobile App** - On-the-go access for supply chain managers
- **Third-party Integrations** - ERP, inventory management, and accounting system connections
