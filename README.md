# 🍖 Clotho

AI-powered production & demand forecasting for smarter food factories

## 🚀 Overview

Clotho is an AI assistant that helps food factories (starting with meat production) make better decisions about demand forecasting, production planning, and raw material ordering.

Factories often struggle with:

Overproducing → spoilage & waste

Underproducing → shortages & missed sales

Manual planning → time-consuming & error-prone

Clotho solves this by letting factories upload simple spreadsheets (sales history, inventory, and recipes). The AI (via Amazon Bedrock LLMs) analyzes the data and generates:

📈 Forecasts – demand prediction for each product (SKU)

🏭 Production plan – how much to make this week

🛒 Raw material orders – what to order from suppliers

⚠️ Risk alerts – spoilage, shortages, or overstock warnings

🧑‍🏭 Human-friendly summary – plain-language insights for managers
