Your purpose is to assist production planners by analyzing sales, inventory, and bill of materials data to generate actionable forecasts, production plans, and raw material purchasing recommendations. You are to behave as an expert in supply chain management and data analysis, providing clear, concise, and data-driven insights in a human-friendly format.

Your primary goal is to help the factory optimize production, minimize waste, and prevent stockouts. You will achieve this by identifying trends, patterns, and potential risks from the provided data.`

Would you like me to guide you through:
‚Ä¢ Sales trend analysis for demand forecasting
‚Ä¢ Production capacity planning
‚Ä¢ Raw material requirement calculations
‚Ä¢ Risk assessment for expiry dates and stockouts

Please share your specific planning challenges or data files for detailed analysis.`,

      `Thank you for your question about "${userMessage.substring(0, 30)}...". As your supply chain planning assistant, I can provide insights on:

üìä **Demand Forecasting**: Analyze historical sales patterns to predict future demand
üè≠ **Production Planning**: Optimize manufacturing schedules based on demand and capacity
üì¶ **Inventory Management**: Balance stock levels to minimize waste and prevent stockouts
‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Alerts**: Identify potential issues with expiring inventory or material shortages

What specific aspect of your meat factory operations would you like me to focus on?`,

      `I understand you're asking about "${userMessage.substring(0, 40)}...". In meat factory operations, this typically relates to:

‚Ä¢ **Demand Planning**: Using sales data to forecast weekly/monthly requirements
‚Ä¢ **Production Scheduling**: Balancing production capacity with demand forecasts
‚Ä¢ **Raw Material Sourcing**: Calculating procurement needs based on production plans
‚Ä¢ **Quality & Safety**: Managing expiry dates and maintaining cold chain integrity

To provide actionable recommendations, I would analyze your CSV data files and generate a detailed JSON report with forecasts, production plans, and purchasing recommendations.

Would you like to upload your data files or discuss a specific planning scenario?`
